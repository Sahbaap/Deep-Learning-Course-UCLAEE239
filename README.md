# Neural-Nets-and-Deep-Learning-UCLA-EE-239
This repository contains the python codes I developed for the NN &amp; DL grad level EE course at UCLA. The course materials and assignments are very similar to the Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition class http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ but they have been modified to fit the UCLA class.
